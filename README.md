## Projects
### Hootel project
During the school training at Progmasters, I took part in the Hootel project, which was divided into three sprint sections. During the continuous development of the website we used different testing techniques and test tools.

Hootel sprint 1: Manual testing and database scanning using SQL. Recording error tickets in JIRA.<br />
Hootel sprint 2: The processes were supplemented with API testing using Postman and SoapUI.<br />
